                    A high quality comfort and construction makes the Zoggs Predator Flex Polarised Ultra Goggle a great choice for any
                    swimmer wanting to get those training lengths in in the pool. Using a unique 4 flexpoint technology for a more adaptable
                    fit, these goggles are soft next to the eye yet remain hugely hydrodynamic. FINA approved, these goggles are finished
                    with an anti-fog treatment, helping you keep clarity.
